<h2>Best Virtual Practices: Teaching Voice Through COVID-19 </h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px; font-style: italic">Sarah Stapleton, Wilfrid Laurier University</h3>
Over the past year, I conducted a research study to analyze best practices for virtual voice lessons and rehearsals. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an ability to adapt music education to virtual settings has become vital for the survival of the discipline. My research analyzed the effectiveness of various online platforms and teaching strategies in making music successfully through the pandemic. Findings from this study may benefit all vocal pedagogues and music educators as they transition to virtual teaching, providing them with strategies for embodied, holistic, and accessible ways to continue making music through an unprecedented time. 

I observed several choral rehearsals of varying genres and levels to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual rehearsal practices through participant observation. I also conducted unstructured interviews with voice instructors and choral directors to learn about their experiences and challenges teaching voice in virtual settings. Lastly, I created a personal journal to depict my own experiences as an undergraduate voice student learning online. I integrated these observations with my work as an opera and musical theatre vocal director as well as a private voice instructor and created a summary of findings based on data from each of these settings. 
My findings illustrated the importance of community connection, humanity, and vulnerability in virtual education, as well as the fundamental accessibility of a practice of singing. These findings may provide educators with a foundation from which to build effective virtual teaching strategies during the pandemic and beyond. 
 

<h2>Using Drag to Explore Gender and Queerness in Songs of Viardot and Contemporaries</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px; font-style: italic">Mike Fan, McGill University </h3>
My project’s aim is a lecture-recital of the art songs of Pauline Viardot (1821-1910) and the composers inspired by her performed in feminine drag. Beyond her operatic stardom, Viardot was a composer, educator, painter, and mother who spoke five languages and influenced many important Romantic composers. However, despite her immense talent and importance, Viardot’s compositions are remain unfairly neglected in concert halls like those of many other women. The programme will include Viardot’s songs based on Chopin mazurkas paired with Chopin’s Polish songs and her Russian romances together with Tchaikovsky’s. This project will examine gender and sexuality by examining the struggles of female composers like Viardot, Chopin’s infamous “femininity” and Tchaikovsky’s homosexuality. This project also spotlights men portraying “feminine” roles in classical music, stigmatized compared to female performers who often perform “trouser roles” and traditionally “male” song cycles (Ashley 2013). The promotional materials will also feature newly commissioned art by BIPOC queer visual artist Tee Kundu. My non-traditional, multimedia approach to art song recital in drag also addresses the need for classical performers to remain relevant and reach new audiences (Plotkin 2017). By embracing women and queer composers, challenging heteronormativity, and presenting new approaches to art song performance, this project aims to empower performers and audiences to create new narratives instead of conforming to the viewpoints of the heterosexual, male creators traditionally favoured in the standard classical canon.

<h2>Healthy Singing Practices: An Analysis of Body Mapping in Vocal Pedagogy</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px; font-style: italic">Sarah Stapleton, Wilfrid Laurier University</h3>
Through this study, I investigated the effectiveness of Body Mapping education for undergraduate-level voice students. I intended to explore the importance of Body Mapping as a foundational component of healthy singing to develop an effective somatic pedagogy for voice teachers. Singers are unique in that their instrument is their body. As such, having a foundational understanding of one's body can provide musicians with a deeper understanding of singing, leading to enhanced performances, heightened personal discoveries, and reduced injury. 

Ontario undergraduate singers were recruited to participate and divided into an experimental and control group. Panelists with experience as a vocal pedagogue or Body Mapping Educator were also recruited. The student groups performed a pre-assigned piece of music, after which the experimental group alone participated in a Body Mapping course. Both groups then performed the piece a second time, one group having received Body Mapping training and one having not. The students self-reported their ease of singing after each performance through a mixed-methods survey and also had both of their performances evaluated by the panel. 

Although I intended to describe the effectiveness of Body Mapping as an aspect of vocal pedagogy, my findings revealed instead the prevalence of teacher bias and the challenge of remaining objective as an evaluator. While my sample size was too small to be generalizable, Body Mapping seemed to counteract the perception of natural decay that occurs when a piece has not been practiced. My findings also revealed significant insights surrounding proper research design. 


<h2>Tracing the Spectre of the Voice: How the Voice Continues to Inform Compositional Practice</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px; font-style: italic">Louis Goldford, Columbia University</h3>
Composer Louis Goldford will present an overview of techniques used in a number of his recent works involving the voice as a principal compositional force — including music with voices and instrumental music whose underlying structures are derived from the voice. 

Contemporary compositional techniques used in the studio for musical creation, often seen as disconnected from the vocal repertoire, will be presented as a recent manifestation of the well-established connective tissue between Western vocal and instrumental musical practices. The voice continues to shape our musical utterances, from antiquity through modern-day source/filter synthesis and instrumental orchestration. 

A few key examples of vocal presence will be given — that is, the literal presence of a voice among instruments, or the sensation of a voice evoked by instrumental aggregates that have been structured to create a vocal mimesis — and will be situated among other recent works and contextualized using the writings of Michel Chion, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, and Stephen McAdams.

<h2>Confronting the Variability of Vocal Vibrato by Genre: A Novel Parametric Approach</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top:10px; font-style: italic">Theodora Nestorova, New England Conservatory of Music</h3>
Vibrato has shifted over decades while the regularity of vibrato remains an important feature deserving further investigation (Herbst et al 2016). Tools of vibrato analysis presuming a western classical opera aesthetic (Nix et al 2006) are applicable only if vibrato is uniform and may disregard various stylistic characteristics of other genres. Therefore, a new system of vibrato metrics taking into account both the variability and shape of the vibrato is essential.

This study aims to define and examine parameters that accurately describe the shape and represent the variability of complex vibrato patterns.

A vocal task protocol including genre-fluid songs and exercises was designed and disseminated to professional operatic, musical theater, and jazz singers. These recordings were subjected to sinusoidal extraction, fO band -pass filtering, and Fast Fourier Transform's long-term average spectrum in Praat. Both constant variables (pitch and vowel) and independent variables (style/singer subject) were assessed.

Vibrato sung by opera singers most often matched a regular monophasic shape with lower Coefficient of Variation (CV).  Musical theater and jazz singers' vibrato contour was multiphasic with a higher CV%. Each vibrato's standard deviation, linear and polynomial regression techniques, and logistic curves coupled with a perceptual study demonstrated the tendencies toward greater extent variability and irregularity in jazz and musical theater versus opera singers. These trends concluded that vibrato shapes may be stratified by genre and grouped into stylistic regions, in both exercises and repertoire.

These novel, comprehensive vibrato models could be effectively employed in voice training within various genres, styles, epochs, etc.
