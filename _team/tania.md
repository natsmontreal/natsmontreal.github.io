Tania teaches voice to a wide age range, both in schools and individual lessons. They are highly interested in the holistic approach to singing and science-informed teaching. Tania is currently pursuing a master's in music theory at McGill University. Not only are they dipping the toe in the many facets of music research and performance, but they also have a knack for sewing and photographing the most random buildings.
