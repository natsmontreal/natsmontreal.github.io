Lesley Findlay has dedicated her life to the study of voice. A singer since childhood, her lifelong passion is to explain complex singing concepts in the easiest way possible. This has led to the unique and innovative approach she has as a singing teacher and vocal pedagogue. Your voice was created perfect; how you use it may not be. Lesley designs the lessons to increase your awareness of the vocal mechanism, identify your particular strengths and weaknesses to then master an efficient vocal production throughout your range.
